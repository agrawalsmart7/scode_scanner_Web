The main features for this tool are:-
<p>
 
1) Scans the whole folder which contains multiple PHP files.<br>
2) It will not only notify you at which file but also which line the vulnerable code exists for quickly identified it.<br>
3) It runs on your localhost, where you will have to give the folder name for scans.<br>
4) Give results out for each file inside the anchors tag (So you can move on to it.)<br>
5) You can add more functions which are dangerous if you found missing any inside the vulnerablefunctions python file.<br>
